## Description

This is a web application that allows the user to search for any number of tv shows, and then sort their episodes based on air date. The purpose of this is to easily allow users to sort through any crossover episodes that related shows may have, as sometimes it can be difficult to know what order to watch these shows in.

## Usage

![episorder](episorder.png)

When you navigate to the page, you can search for any tv show by entering it into the input box and clicking 'Add Show'. At this point, a modal window will open with all shows matching the search. Select the correct show by clicking on the picture of the show, and it will be added to the list of shows waiting to be sorted. Add as many shows as you'd like. Once you have added all the shows you want to sort, click 'Sort Episodes'. You will see every episode of all shows listed in order by their air date. If you want to make a new search, simply click 'Clear Results', and you can start a new search.
